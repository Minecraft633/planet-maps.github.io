<title>Steve Albers' Planetary Maps (Global Images)</title>
<center><h1>Planetary Maps (Global Images)</h1></center>

<center><h3>by <em>Steve Albers</em></h3></center>

This image processing outlined on this page
has been done in part to provide "value-added" global planet & satellite images 
to
NOAA's
<a href="https://sos.noaa.gov/Datasets/">
Science On a Sphere</a><sup>&reg;</sup>
project. 
The ones I've processed are mostly via some IDL procedures that I put together.
Other images available from various groups and individuals
on the internet are
being used "as-is".
The 
images (in cylindrical projection)
are generally centered on +/-180 degrees longitude and are
2K (2048x1024) pixels in size unless otherwise noted.
Several of the satellites are modeled as triaxial ellipsoids. In
these cases the maps are constructed on the ellipsoid 
using planetocentric coordinates.
Some of these are works in progress to be updated in the future.

<A NAME="SATURN"</a>

<center><h2>Saturn</h2></center>

We are using a map of 
<a href="https://bjj.mmedia.is/data/saturn/index.html">Saturn</a>
from 
<a href="https://bjj.mmedia.is/data/planetary_maps.html">Bjorn Jonsson's</a>
web site.

<p>
Following is a series of satellite maps representing a combination of Voyager and Cassini spacecraft
imagery. Navigation information used in reprojecting 
Cassini images was obtained in part
from Mark Showalter's Cassini Satellite ephemeris website. 
A helpful 
<a href="http://www.planetary.org/explore/topics/cassini_huygens/data_iss.html">image summary</a>
is being used courtesy of The Planetary Society.
Matching of topographic
features was also done to help in registering the images.
It is anticipated that the typical accuracy of the navigation of 
the images is roughly within the 1-2 degree range.
Please note that some of the Cassini images used are "raw" images that are uncalibrated and unprocessed.

<A NAME="MIMAS"</a>
<center><h3>
Mimas
<br>
</center></h3>
<p>
Below is a map of Mimas I constructed by
reprojecting and overlaying about 15 Cassini images representing
~90% coverage on top of the official mosaic found on the Cassini web site (used for ~10% coverage). 
The Cassini images and mosaics are from NASA/JPL/<a href="http://ciclops.org">Space Science Institute</a>.

<A NAME="ENCELADUS"</a>
<center><h3>
Enceladus
<br>
</center></h3>
Below is an 8K map of Enceladus I constructed by
reprojecting and overlaying about 50 Cassini
images
on top of a 
<a href="/albers/sos/saturn/enceladus/enceladus.jpg">previous map</a> 
using Voyager images from
<a href="http://www.ssc.uwo.ca/geography/spacemap/contents.htm">Philip J. Stooke</a>
and
<a href="http://home.arcor.de/jimpage/saturn.html">Jens Meyer</a>.
Two Cassini raw images from a mid-January 2005 flyby were used along with 
eight "raw preview" images, three "raw" images,
one raw wide-angle image and one mosaic from a mid-February 2005 flyby.
Nine PDS images, three raw preview images, two false color images, a high-res mosaic, and one raw image
were used from the March 2005 flyby. An untargeted flyby in May 2005 provided a look at
the south polar region. 
About a dozen images (a combination of PDS, raw, and processed)
from the July 2005 flyby dramatically improved the south polar coverage.
Images from November 2006 and September 2007 are included. A few images from
the March, August, and October 2008 flybys are also being utilized as well as
from November 2009.
Color information from a regional mosaic is being added.
The Cassini images are from
NASA
/
<a href="http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/multimedia/images/raw/index.cfm">JPL</a>
/
<a href="http://ciclops.org">Space Science Institute</a>.
Navigation information from the PDS
along with 
an Enceladus map from the JPL Photojournal (PIA08417) 
was used to help position many of the images.
Thanks to Jason Perry of the University of Arizona and Emily Lakdawalla of the
Planetary Society for help with the PDS data/images.

constructed in 2018 from Ian Regan and the USGS using Cassini images.

Below is a map of Titan I constructed by
reprojecting and overlaying three high-resolution Cassini
images/mosaics from recent 2007 flybys on 
top of a 

<a href="/albers/sos/saturn/titan/titan_fridger.jpg">previous map</a> 
using lower resolution Saturn approach images from
<a href="http://www.shatters.net/~t00fri/texfoundry.php4">Fridger Schrempp</a>
and the 
previous (December 2006) map from the
<a href="http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA08346">NASA Cassini mission</a>
. The image from October 22, 2007 was post-processed by Gordan Ugarkovic.

<!--
One mosaic and one single image were used from the T0 flyby together with
one mosaic and one single image from the TA flyby, as processed by
the 
<a href="http://ciclops.org">CICLOPS Cassini imaging team
</a>. A mosaic from T4 was also utilized.

The black & white images were generally taken through near infrared and polarizing filters to
pierce the haze on Titan.
