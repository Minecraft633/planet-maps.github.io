<center><h1>PPlanetary Maps cuz why not</h1></center>

This image processing outlined on this page
has been done in part to provide "value-added" global planet & satellite images 
to
NOAA's
<a href="https://sos.noaa.gov/Datasets/">
Science On a Sphere</a><sup>&reg;</sup>
project. 
The ones I've processed are mostly via some IDL procedures that I put together.
Other images available from various groups and individuals
on the internet are
being used "as-is".
The 
images (in cylindrical projection)
are generally centered on +/-180 degrees longitude and are
2K (2048x1024) pixels in size unless otherwise noted.
Several of the satellites are modeled as triaxial ellipsoids. In
these cases the maps are constructed on the ellipsoid 
using planetocentric coordinates.
Some of these are works in progress to be updated in the future.

Below is an 8K map of Dione I constructed by
reprojecting and overlaying images from recent Cassini flybys
on top of a 
<a href="/albers/sos/saturn/dione/dione.jpg">previous map</a> 
using Voyager images made by
<a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/science/schenk/schenk.html">Paul Schenk</a>
of the Lunar and Planetary Institute.
A Voyager image processed by 
<a href="http://www.strykfoto.org/outericymoons/vdionef.png">
Ted Stryk 
</a>
was also incorporated.
A <a href="http://ciclops.org/view.php?id=1583">mosaic</a> was added along with a raw image from the October 11, 2005 flyby. 
A raw image is included from the September 30, 2007 flyby as well as a mosaic
constructed by "nick1drake" of UnmannedSpaceflight.com.
With the September 2010 flyby showing some northern regions, a mosiac by
"Exploitcorporations" of UnmannedSpaceflight.com was used along with a couple of Saturnshine raw images.
The Cassini images are from
